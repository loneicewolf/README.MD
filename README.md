### Experiences

I first got in to Cryptography and infosec (And, among other topics - including Malware's & stuff) - around the age of 16.
where I also experimented much with Arduino and Raspberry Pi's.

After after some time though, later I became very fascinated in a specific topic, which was Cryptography Engineering. - Since then I have been very interested in it.

#### Certifications:
  - [x] Cryptography I Stanford University https://coursera.org/share/86b7ad20156fa1ec1eead7ddb5cba366  (**First course I completed at the age of 20 or so, 2020 September, 22:**)
  - [x]  DART.IMT.C.01: C Programming: Getting Started   https://courses.edx.org/certificates/cdb01cd9b4234d7ca3f85be19b81475a (**Very much more coming soon**) 
  - [ ]  **Professional Certificate inC Programming with Linux** Not Yet Done. **(Partially Completed)** (Coming trough! - and that is quickly..)
  https://credentials.edx.org/records/programs/shared/fb0f3a74321848018571b2468805e844/ 


### (Note,  I have programmed C and C++ long long before I begun the course, I just wanted a proof that I actually **know** programming, so that's why I am going for the Professional Certificate, Because without it I cannot be certain that I **know** programming, or even doing it the right way.)
